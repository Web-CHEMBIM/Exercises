SECTION C: Short Answer (Key Points)
1. Current = charge passing a point / per unit time (or rate of flow of charge)
3. Free electrons drift through lattice of fixed positive ions; 
   electrons move from - to + terminal; ions vibrate but don't move
4. (i) Digital gives numerical reading, analogue uses needle/pointer
   (ii) Digital more precise / easier to read / no parallax error
5. Conventional current defined before electrons discovered; 
   assumed positive charges moved; electrons are negative so move opposite way
6. (i) d.c. flows in one direction, a.c. changes direction
   (ii) d.c. has constant value, a.c. varies/oscillates
7. Maximum reading is 1 A; 5 A exceeds the range; would damage ammeter 
   or needle would go past maximum

SECTION D: Calculations
1. t = 2 × 60 = 120 s; Q = I × t = 2.0 × 120 = 240 C
2. I = Q/t = 150/30 = 5.0 A
3. t = Q/I = 1800/6.0 = 300 s
4a. t = 1 × 60 × 60 = 3600 s; Q = I × t = 2.0 × 3600 = 7200 C
4b. t = Q/I = 18000/2.0 = 9000 s = 2.5 hours
5. I = 20 mA = 0.020 A; Q = I × t = 0.020 × 10 = 0.20 C
6. I = Q/t = 15/0.0003 = 50000 A

SECTION E: True or False
1. FALSE - Current is flow of charge (electrons in metals are negative)
2. TRUE
3. FALSE - Ammeter must be connected in SERIES, not parallel
4. TRUE
5. TRUE

SECTION F: Matching
1-C, 2-D, 3-A, 4-B, 5-E

SECTION G: Structured Question (Key Points)
(a) Measures the current flowing through the circuit
(b)(i) Charge passing a point per unit time / rate of flow of charge
(b)(ii) t = 5 × 60 = 300 s; Q = I × t = 0.40 × 300 = 120 C
(c) Free electrons drift from - to + terminal; move between fixed positive 
    metal ions; ions vibrate but stay in position
(d)(i) Current that changes direction periodically / reverses direction
(d)(ii) Electrons move back and forth / oscillate instead of drifting 
        in one direction
(e) Before electrons discovered, scientists assumed positive charges moved; 
    conventional current defined as + to -; electrons are negative so
