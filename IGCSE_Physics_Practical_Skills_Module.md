## Practical Question Types

### 1. Variables Identification

```
A student investigates how the extension of a spring depends on 
the load applied.

(a) State the independent variable. [1]
(b) State the dependent variable. [1]
(c) State one variable that should be kept constant. [1]
```

**Mark Scheme:**
- (a) Load / force / weight / mass [B1]
- (b) Extension / length increase [B1]
- (c) Same spring / same material / temperature [B1]

### 2. Data Table Design

```
A student measures the temperature of water as it cools.

(a) Design a suitable table to record time and temperature 
    for 5 readings. [3]
```

**Mark Scheme:**
- B1: Two columns with correct headings (time, temperature)
- B1: Correct units in headings (s or min, °C)
- B1: At least 5 rows for data entries

### 3. Graph Plotting Criteria

| Criterion | Marks | Requirement |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Axis labels | 1 | Both axes labeled with quantity and unit |
| Scale | 1 | Linear, appropriate, uses >50% of grid |
| Points | 1 | Plotted accurately (within half a small square) |
| Line | 1 | Best-fit line (straight or curve as appropriate) |

### 4. Error Analysis

```
A student measures the period of a pendulum.

(a) Suggest one source of random error. [1]
(b) Suggest one source of systematic error. [1]
(c) Explain how to reduce random error in this experiment. [2]
```

**Mark Scheme:**

- (b) Parallax error reading ruler / zero error on timer [B1]
- (c) Take multiple readings [B1] and calculate mean/average [B1]
