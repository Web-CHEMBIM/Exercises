1. R = V/I (B1)

2. (a) In series with the component/resistor (B1)
   (b) In parallel with the component/resistor (B1)
   (c) R = V/I = 4.8/0.80 = 6.0 Ω (M1 for formula, A1 for answer)

3. Because the resistance is constant (B1)
   V and I are directly proportional / V = IR with constant R (B1)

4. (i) Length (B1)
   (ii) Cross-sectional area / thickness / diameter (B1)
   Also accept: material / temperature

5. (a) Resistance triples / becomes 6.0 Ω (B1)
   (b) Resistance halves / becomes 1.0 Ω (B1)

SECTION D: CALCULATIONS

2. (a) R = V/I = 12/0.50 = 24 Ω (M1, A1)
   (b) Resistance increases (B1)
      Because the temperature of the filament increases / 
      atoms vibrate more so electrons collide more (B1)

3. I = V/R = 24/8.0 = 3.0 A (M1, A1)

4. I = V/R = 240/20 = 12 A (M1, A1)

SECTION E: TRUE OR FALSE
1. TRUE
2. FALSE - A diode has very high resistance in reverse direction / 
   low resistance in forward direction
3. FALSE - The I-V graph for a filament lamp is a curve / curved line
4. FALSE - An ammeter should be connected in SERIES

SECTION G: STRUCTURED QUESTION
1. (a) Method description should include:
   - Connect the circuit as shown / connect ammeter in series (B1)
   - Connect voltmeter in parallel across the wire (B1)
   - Measure voltage and current for different lengths (B1)

   - Calculate resistance using R = V/I (B1)
   - Repeat for different lengths (B1)
   (Max 4 marks)

   (b) (i) Completed table:
       | 20 cm | 2.0 Ω |
       | 40 cm | 4.0 Ω |
       | 60 cm | 6.0 Ω |
       | 80 cm | 8.0 Ω |
       | 100 cm | 10 Ω |
       (B1 for first two correct, B1 for all correct)

   (ii) Resistance is proportional to length / resistance increases 
        as length increases (B1)

   (iii) When length doubles from 20 to 40 cm, resistance doubles 
         from 2.0 to 4.0 Ω (B1)
         OR: R/L is constant = 0.1 Ω/cm (B1)
         This shows direct proportionality (B1)

   (c) Diameter doubles means cross-sectional area quadruples (B1)
       Resistance is inversely proportional to area (B1)
       So resistance decreases to 1/4 of original value (B1)
