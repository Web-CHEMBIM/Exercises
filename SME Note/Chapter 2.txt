Speed & Velocity

Your notes

Speed
The speed of an object is defined as
Distance travelled per unit time
Speed is a scalar quantity
This is because it only contains a magnitude (without a direction)
For objects that are moving at a constant speed, the equation for calculating speed is:

v=

s
t

Where:

v = speed, measured in metres per second (m/s)
s = distance travelled, measured in metres (m)
t = time, measured in seconds (s)

Average speed
The speed of an object can vary throughout its journey
Therefore, it is often more useful to know an object's average speed

Examples of average speeds
Average walking speed = 1.5 m/s
Average running speed = 3 m/s
Average cycling speed = 6 m/s

Your notes

A hiker might have an average speed of 2.0 m/s, whereas a particularly excited bumble
bee can have average speeds of up to 4.5 m/s
A car travels at different instantaneous speeds throughout its journey
The car speeds up and slows down
The car may stop at junctions and traffic lights
The average speed of the journey of the car can be found by dividing the total distance
travelled by the total time taken
The equation for calculating the average speed of an object is:

Average speed =

distance travelled
time taken

Average speed considers the total distance travelled and the total time taken

Formula triangle for average speed, distance moved and time taken

How to use formula triangles

Your notes

Formula triangles are really useful for knowing how to rearrange physics equations
To use them:
1. Cover up the quantity to be calculated, this is known as the 'subject' of the equation
2. Look at the position of the other two quantities
If they are on the same line, this means they are multiplied
If one quantity is above the other, this means they are divided - make sure to keep
the order of which is on the top and bottom of the fraction!
In the example below, to calculate average speed, cover-up the variable speed so that
only distance and time are left
The equation is revealed as:

speed =

distance
time

To use a formula triangle, simply cover up the quantity you wish calculate and the
structure of the equation is revealed

Worked Example
Planes fly at typical average speeds of around 250 m/s.
Calculate the distance travelled by a plane moving at this average speed for 2 hours.
Answer:
Step 1: List the known quantities
Average speed = 250 m/s

Time taken = 2 hours
Step 2: Write the relevant equation

distance travelled
average speed =
time taken

Your notes

Step 3: Rearrange to make distance moved the subject

distance travelled = average speed × time taken
Step 4: Convert any units
The time given in the question is not in standard units
Convert 2 hours into seconds:
2 hours = 2 × 60 × 60

2 hours = 7200 s
Step 5: Substitute the values for average speed and time taken

distance travelled = 250 × 7200
distance travelled = 1 800 000 m

Examiner Tips and Tricks
Rearranging equations is an important skill in Physics. You can use the equation
triangles to help you practice, but it is better not to rely on them because they do not
work for all equations you may need to rearrange in the exam.

Velocity
Velocity is a vector quantity with magnitude and direction
Velocity is defined as:
Speed in a given direction
The direction of a velocity can be given in words
For example, 20 m/s east
Or the direction of velocity can be given using a positive or negative value
For example, −20 m/s
A positive direction is typically in the direction of the initial motion, to the right, or upward
A negative velocity is typically in the opposite direction to the initial velocity, to the left,
or downward

Your notes

The cars in the diagram above have the same speed (a scalar quantity) but different
velocities (a vector quantity). Fear not, they are in different lanes!

Examiner Tips and Tricks
The positive and negative values of velocity can be assigned to any direction as long
as the negative velocity is in the opposite direction to the positive value. You can
decide which direction you assign to be positive as long as you are consistent
throughout a question.
The equation for velocity is very similar to the equation for speed:

v=

s
t

Where:

v = velocity in metres per second (m/s)
s = displacement, measured in metres (m)
t = time, measured in seconds (s)
Velocity is a vector quantity, so it uses displacement, s, which is another vector quantity

Acceleration

Your notes

Acceleration
Extender tier only
Acceleration describes how the velocity of an object changes over time
Acceleration is defined as:
The rate of change of velocity
In other words, acceleration is the change in velocity per unit time
The acceleration of an object is often changing throughout an object's journey
Therefore, is it often useful to know the average acceleration

a=

∆v
∆t

Where:

a = acceleration in metres per second squared (m/s2)
∆ v = change in velocity in metres per second (m/s)
∆ t = time taken in seconds (s)

Formula triangle for acceleration, change in velocity and
change in time

The change in velocity is the difference between the initial and final velocity:

∆v = v − u

Your notes

Where:

∆ v = change in velocity in metres per second (m/s)

v = final velocity in metres per second (m/s)
u = initial velocity in metres per second (m/s)

Speeding up & slowing down
An object can change its velocity in several ways:
speeding up
slowing down
changing direction
Any change in an object's velocity is an acceleration
When an object speeds up, it is accelerating
This is positive acceleration
When an object slows down, it is decelerating
This is negative acceleration
Acceleration is positive if its direction is in the same direction as the motion of the
object

A rocket speeding up (accelerating) and a car slowing down (decelerating)

Worked Example
A Japanese bullet train decelerates at a constant rate in a straight line. The velocity of
the train decreases from 50 m/s to 42 m/s in 30 seconds.
(a) Calculate the change in velocity of the train.
(b) Calculate the deceleration of the train, and explain how your answer shows the
train is slowing down.
Answer:
Part (a)
Step 1: List the known quantities
Initial velocity, u = 50 m/s
Final velocity, v = 42 m/s
Step 2: Write the equation for change in velocity

∆v = v − u
Step 3: Substitute values for final and initial velocity

∆ v = 42 − 50
∆ v = − 8 m/s

Step 3: Substitute the values for change in velocity and time

a=

−8

30

a = − 0 . 27 m/s2
Step 4: Interpret the value for deceleration
The answer is negative, which indicates the train is slowing down

Examiner Tips and Tricks
Remember, the units for acceleration are metres per second squared, m/s2. In other
words, acceleration measures how much the velocity (m/s) changes every second, so
the units are metres per second per second (m/s/s).

Distance-Time Graphs

Your notes

Distance-time graphs
A distance-time graph is used to describe the motion of an object and calculate its
speed

Distance-time graph of an object moving at a constant speed

The graph shows a moving object moving further away from its origin at a constant speed

Constant speed on a distance-time graph
If an object is moving at a constant speed, the distance-time graph will be a straight line
If the constant speed is zero, the line will be horizontal
If the constant speed is non-zero, the line will have a gradient
If an object has a speed of zero, the object is stationary
The distance moved by the object over time is zero
The gradient of a distance-time graph represents the magnitude of the object's
velocity, or its speed
A steeper slope, or a higher gradient, represents a greater speed
A shallower slope, or a lower gradient, represents a slower speed

Both of these objects are moving at a constant speed, because the lines are straight. The
steeper slope represents the faster speed and the shallower line represents the slower
speed.

Changing speed on a distance-time graph
Often, the speed of an object is not constant
If the speed of an object is changing, the object is accelerating
If an object is accelerating, the distance-time graph will be a curved line
A curve on a distance-time graph is a changing gradient
If the gradient increases over time, the speed is increasing over time
If the gradient decreases over time, the speed is decreasing over time

Changing speeds are represented by changing slopes, or gradients. The red line shows a
decreasing gradient and represents an object slowing down, or decelerating. The green

Examiner Tips and Tricks
When calculating a gradient, use the entire line where possible. Examiners tend to
award credit if they see a large gradient triangle used, so you need to actually draw
the lines directly on the graph itself!

Your notes

Remember to check the units on each axis. These may not always be in standard units;
in our example, the unit of distance was km and the unit of time was minutes. Doublecheck which units to use in your answer.
You could also be asked to plot a distance time graph from data given to you in a
question, or be asked to describe the motion of an object from the data given.

(a) In which section (A, B, C, D, or E) of the speed-time graph is the cyclist's
acceleration the largest?
(b) Calculate the cyclist's acceleration between 5 and 10 seconds.

Answer:
Part (a)
Step 1: Recall that the slope of a speed-time graph represents the magnitude of
acceleration
The slope of a speed-time graph indicates the magnitude of acceleration
Therefore, the only sections of the graph where the cyclist is accelerating are
sections B and D
Sections A, C, and E are flat; in other words, the cyclist is moving at a constant
velocity (therefore, not accelerating)
Step 2: Identify the section with the steepest slope
Section D of the graph has the steepest slope
Hence, the largest acceleration is shown in section D
Part (b)
Step 1: Recall that the gradient of a speed-time graph gives the acceleration
Calculating the gradient of a slope on a speed-time graph gives the acceleration
for that time period

Freefall

Your notes

Acceleration of free fall
In the absence of air resistance, all objects fall with the same acceleration regardless of
their mass
This is called the acceleration of freefall
This is also sometimes called acceleration due to gravity

acceleration of freefall = g = 9 . 8 m/s2

In the absence of air resistance, Galileo discovered that all objects (near Earth's surface)
fall with an acceleration of about 9.8 m/s2
This means that for every second an object falls, its velocity will increase by 9.8 m/s
The symbol g also stands for the gravitational field strength, and can be used to
calculate the force of weight acting an object using its mass:

W = mg
Where:

W = the force of weight acting on an object, measured in newtons (N)
m = mass of object, measured in kilograms (kg)

Motion of falling objects

Your notes

Extended tier only

Falling objects without air resistance
A vacuum is a space that contains no matter, so there are no particles to exert frictional
forces on a falling object
When objects fall in a vacuum, there is no air resistance or liquid resistance so the only
force acting on them is the force of weight

W = mg
Newton's second law of motion describes acceleration as:

a=

F
m

Where:

a = acceleration, measured in metres per second squared (m/s2)
F = force exerted on object, measured in newtons (N)
m = mass of object, measured in kilograms (kg)
Since the only force acting on a falling object in a vacuum is weight, the equation can be
expressed as

a=

W
m

Weight is the product of mass and gravitational field strength, so the equation can be
expressed as

a=

mg
m

Here, the masses cancel each other out

a=

mg
m

So, for objects falling in a vacuum

a=g
Where g = acceleration of free fall
This theory was tested by astronauts on the Moon

A hammer and a feather were dropped from equal heights on the Moon, where there
is no air resistance
The hammer and the feather fell with the same acceleration and landed at the same
time

Your notes

This proved that objects falling in a vacuum have the same acceleration regardless
of their mass
This also applies when air resistance is so small that it can be disregarded
When air resistance is described as negligible, it can be approximated to an object
is falling in a vacuum

Object falling with no air resistance

In the absence of air resistance, objects fall with constant acceleration
Objects falling through a vacuum will never reach a terminal velocity

Falling objects with air resistance
When objects fall through a fluid, the fluid exerts a frictional force on the object as it falls
Fluids are liquids or gases
Frictional forces oppose the motion of an object
They act to slow it down
When an object falls through air, it experiences air resistance
Air resistance is a frictional force produced by collisions with air particles as the
object moves through the air
Air resistance increases as the speed of the object increases
When objects fall through air, two forces are exerted on the object:
The force of weight

The force of air resistance
When the force of air resistance becomes equal to the force of weight, then the object
stops accelerating and falls at a constant speed

Your notes

This is called terminal velocity

How does a skydiver reach terminal velocity?

The stages of a skydivers fall until they reach terminal velocity
When a skydiver jumps out of a plane, initially the only force acting on them is weight
The resultant force acts in the downward direction
The skydiver accelerates
As the skydiver accelerates, their speed increases, so the force of air resistance
increases
The resultant force acts in the downward direction with a smaller magnitude
The skydiver continues to accelerate but at a slower rate
Air resistance increases until it is equal to the weight
The forces are balanced
There is no resultant force
Terminal velocity is reached
The parachute is deployed, increasing the surface area of the skydiver

The parachute collides with many more air particles
Air resistance increases greatly
The force of air resistance is now greater than the force of weight

Your notes

The resultant force acts in the upward direction
The skydiver continues falling in a downward direction
The skydiver is decelerating
As the skydiver decelerates, their speed decreases
Therefore, air resistance decreases
Therefore, the resultant force decreases
Air resistance decreases until it is equal to the weight
The forces are balanced
There is no resultant force
A new, slower terminal velocity is reached

Worked Example
A small object falls out of an aircraft. Choose words from the list to complete the
sentences below:
air resistance gravitational field strength air pressure
accelerates falls at a steady speed slows down

(a) The weight of an object is the product of the object's mass and the __________.
(b) When an object falls, initially it ____________.
(c) As the object falls faster, the force of ______________ acting upon the object
increases.
(d) Eventually the object ______________ when the force of friction equals the force
of weight acting on it.
Answer:
Part (a)
The weight of an object is the product of the object's mass and the gravitational field
strength.
The weight force is due to the Earth's gravitational pull on the object's mass as it
falls through a uniform gravitational field
Part (b)
When an object falls, initially it accelerates.
The resultant force on the object is very large initially, so it accelerates
This is because there is a large unbalanced force downwards (its weight) - the
upward force of air resistance is very small to begin with
Part (c)
As the object falls faster, the force of air resistance acting on the object increases.
The force of air resistance is due to friction between the object's motion and
collisions with air particles
Collisions with air particles slow the object down, so air itself produces a
frictional force, called air resistance (sometimes called drag)
Part (d)
Eventually, the object falls at a steady speed when the force of friction equals the
force of weight acting on it.
When the upward acting air resistance increases enough to balance the
downward weight force, the resultant force on the object is zero

This means the object is no longer accelerating; it is moving at a steady speed
called terminal velocity

Your notes

Examiner Tips and Tricks
Don't confuse 'air resistance' with 'air pressure' - these are two different concepts!
Exam questions about terminal velocity tend to involve the motion of skydivers as
they fall
A common misconception is that skydivers move upwards when their parachutes are
deployed; however, this is not the case, they are in fact decelerating to a lower
terminal velocity
