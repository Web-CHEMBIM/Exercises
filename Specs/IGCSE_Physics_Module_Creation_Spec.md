## Module Components

### 1. Module Overview

| Component | Description | Requirements |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Title** | Clear, descriptive module name | Match syllabus topic/subtopic title |
| **Learning Objectives** | What students will achieve | Use SMART format; align with syllabus LOs |
| **Prerequisites** | Prior knowledge required | List specific concepts/skills needed |
| **Estimated Time** | Study duration | 30–60 minutes per section |
| **Key Vocabulary** | Essential terms | 5–10 terms with definitions |

#### Learning Objective Format

Write objectives using this structure:

```
By the end of this section, students should be able to:
• [Action Verb] + [Content] + [Context/Condition]
```

**Example:**
> By the end of this section, students should be able to:
> - **Define** speed as distance travelled per unit time
> - **Calculate** speed using the equation v = s/t for various scenarios
> - **Distinguish** between speed and velocity

#### Bloom's Taxonomy Verb Alignment

| Cognitive Level | Verbs to Use | Typical Question Type |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Remember** | Define, State, List, Name, Recall, Identify | Fill-in-blank, MCQ |
| **Understand** | Describe, Explain, Compare, Outline, Summarize | Short answer |
| **Apply** | Calculate, Use, Apply, Determine, Show | Calculation |

---

### 2. Section Structure

Each section within a module follows **Gagne's 9 Events of Instruction**:

| Event | Purpose | Module Element |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 1. Gain Attention | Capture interest | **Hook** (real-world scenario, question, surprising fact) |
| 2. Inform Objectives | Set expectations | **Learning Objectives** at section start |
| 3. Stimulate Recall | Activate prior knowledge | **Recall Questions** linking to previous topics |
| 4. Present Content | Deliver new material | **Core Content** with explanations |
| 5. Provide Guidance | Support understanding | **Worked Examples** with step-by-step solutions |
| 6. Elicit Performance | Practice new skills | **Try It Yourself** exercises |
| 7. Provide Feedback | Correct errors | **Answers with explanations** |
| 8. Assess Performance | Evaluate mastery | **Check Your Understanding** questions |
| 9. Enhance Retention | Aid long-term memory | **Summary**, **Key Points**, **Concept Maps** |

---

### 3. Content Guidelines

#### Dual Coding: Text + Visuals

Every major concept should be presented with both verbal and visual representations:

| Content Type | Visual Support |
|--------------|----------------|
| Formulas | Annotated equation with labeled variables |
| Processes | Flowchart or step diagram |
| Relationships | Graph or concept map |
| Comparisons | Side-by-side table or Venn diagram |
| Real-world context | Labeled photograph or illustration |
| Abstract concepts | Analogy diagram |

#### Content Chunking Rules

| Rule | Guideline |
|------|-----------|
| **7±2 Rule** | Present 5–9 items per chunk |
| **One Concept Per Paragraph** | Focus on single idea |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Simple → Complex |
| **Concrete Before Abstract** | Examples before definitions |

#### Language Guidelines

| Aspect | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| **Reading Level** | Appropriate for ages 14–16 (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8–10) |
| **Sentence Length** | Average 15–20 words |
| **Active Voice** | Prefer "Calculate the speed" over "The speed should be calculated" |
| **Technical Terms** | Define on first use; include in glossary |
| **Pronouns** | Use "you" to address students directly |

---

### 4. Worked Example Structure

Worked examples are critical for procedural knowledge. Use this template:

```
### Worked Example [N]

**Problem:**
[Clear problem statement with given values and required quantity]

**Solution:**

Step 1: [Identify what is given and what is required]
- Given: [List values with units]
- Required: [Target quantity]

Step 2: [Select the appropriate equation]
- Equation: [Formula]

Step 3: [Substitute values]
- [Show substitution]

Step 4: [Calculate]
- [Show calculation]

Step 5: [State the answer with correct units and significant figures]
- Answer: [Value with unit]

**Key Points:**
- [Important takeaway 1]
- [Important takeaway 2]
```

#### Worked Example Progression

| Level | Complexity | Support Provided |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| **Basic** | Single-step, all values given | Fully worked, detailed steps |
| **Guided** | Two-step, unit conversion | Partially worked, some steps for student |
| **Independent** | Multi-step, extract from context | Problem only, solution hidden |

---

### 5. Formative Assessment

Integrate frequent checks to monitor understanding:

| Assessment Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| **Quick Quiz** | After each key concept | Immediate recall check |
| **Knowledge Check** | End of each section | Section mastery verification |
| **Practice Problems** | After worked examples | Application of procedures |
| **Self-Assessment** | End of module | Student reflection on mastery |

#### Question Distribution per Section

| Cognitive Level | Percentage | Count (for 10 questions) |
|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Remember (AO1) | 30% | 3 |
| Apply (AO2) | 50% | 5 |
| Analyze (AO3) | 20% | 2 |

---

### 6. Common Misconceptions

Each section should explicitly address known student misconceptions:

```
### Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Correction |
|---------------|------------|
| [Wrong belief] | [Correct understanding] |
| [Wrong belief] | [Correct understanding] |
```

**Example (Motion topic):**

| Misconception | Correction |
|---------------|------------|
| "Speed and velocity are the same" | Speed is a scalar (magnitude only); velocity is a vector (magnitude + direction) |
| "Negative acceleration always means slowing down" | Negative acceleration means acceleration in the negative direction; the object could be speeding up if moving in the negative direction |

---

## Module Formatting Standards

### Typography

| Element | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Module Title | `# Heading 1` |
| Section Title | `## Heading 2` |
| Subsection Title | `### Heading 3` |
| Key Terms | **Bold** on first use |
| Formulas | LaTeX notation: `$v = \frac{s}{t}$` |
| Units | Upright text: m/s, kg, N |
| Variables | Italic: *v*, *s*, *t* |

### Visual Formatting

| Element | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Definitions | Blockquote (`>`) or callout box |
| Equations | Centered, numbered |
| Tables | Use for comparisons, data |
| Diagrams | Referenced as "Fig. N" |
| Important Notes | Use alerts: `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!CAUTION]` |

### Equation Numbering

```
$$v = \frac{s}{t} \tag{2.1}$$
```

Numbering format: `[Module].[Equation Number]`

## Module Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis

1. **Identify syllabus reference** — Which topic/subtopic from the JSON data?
2. **List learning objectives** — Extract Core and Supplement objectives
3. **Determine prerequisites** — What must students already know?
4. **Identify key vocabulary** — What terms need definition?

### Phase 2: Design

1. **Structure sections** — Group related learning objectives
2. **Plan assessment** — What questions will measure each objective?
3. **Identify visuals** — What diagrams/graphs are needed?
4. **Plan worked examples** — What calculations need demonstration?

### Phase 3: Development

1. **Write content** — Follow section structure template
2. **Create visuals** — Using IGCSE_Physics_Diagram_Generation_Spec.md
3. **Develop questions** — Using IGCSE_Physics_Exercise_Generation_Spec.md
4. **Add formative checks** — Quick quizzes after each concept

### Phase 4: Review

1. **Technical review** — Verify accuracy of physics content
2. **Pedagogical review** — Ensure learning progression is logical
3. **Quality check** — Use checklist above
4. **Student pilot** — Test with target audience if possible
