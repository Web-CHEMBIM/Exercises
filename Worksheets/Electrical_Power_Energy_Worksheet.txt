    B1: Electrical energy supplied
    B1: Transferred to kinetic/movement energy (and some heat energy)

24. a) [1 mark]
       B1: It is the SI unit / universally recognized / used in scientific calculations
    
    b) [1 mark]
       B1: Gives convenient numbers / easier to understand for consumers / 
           avoids very large numbers
    
    c) [2 marks]
       B1: Household appliances use large amounts of energy
       B1: Using joules would give very large numbers that are difficult to work with

### Section G: True/False
25. a) FALSE [2 marks]
       B1: For identifying as false
       B1: A high-power device used for a short time may use less energy than a 
           low-power device used for a long time (or similar explanation involving time)
    
    b) TRUE [2 marks]
       B1: For identifying as true
       B1: P = IV, so if V is constant and I doubles, P doubles
    
    c) FALSE [2 marks]
       B1: For identifying as false
       B1: One kW h equals 3,600,000 J (or 3.6 × 10⁶ J)
    
    d) TRUE [2 marks]
       B1: For identifying as true
       B1: All energy transfers eventually produce heat due to resistance/friction/
           inefficiency, which is transferred to surroundings

### Section H: Error Analysis
26. a) [1 mark]
       B1: The student added instead of multiplying / used + instead of ×
    
    b) [2 marks]

       A1: P = 5.4 W

27. a) [1 mark]
       B1: The student divided by cost instead of multiplying
    
    b) [2 marks]
       M1: Cost = energy × unit cost = 6 × 0.10
       A1: Cost = $0.60 (Note: coincidentally same number but correct method)
       [Alternative if student realizes the answer is the same:]
       B1: Recognizes the division gave the same numerical answer but wrong method
